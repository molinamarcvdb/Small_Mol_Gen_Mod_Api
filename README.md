# Hit_Expansion_Generative_Modelling

This repository contains the source code for our Small Molecule Targeted Generative Modelling API, a project for Artificial Intelligence in Drug Discovery, a module from the Medical Informatics MSc at fachhochschule nordwestschweiz (FHNW), Muttenz, Switzerland. Our tool consist on a user-friendly interface for hit expansion that given a initial hit the suer can expand its hit with similar compound with varied properties.

## Introduction
The exploration and generation of novel molecular structures is a critical aspect of drug discovery and related fields. Traditional methods can be time-consuming and expensive, making the use of computational models increasingly attractive. Our API utilizes a generative model approach, learning from a large dataset of molecular structures expressed in the SELFIES language - a 100% robust molecular string representation developed in [1].

The generative model employed here has been trained to produce molecular structures with properties similar to those in the training dataset. This opens the possibility for usage in virtual screening tasks or for training semi-supervised predictive models in downstream tasks.

Recognizing the challenge in comparing and ranking different generative models, we've integrated the Molecular Sets (MOSES) benchmarking platform developed by Polykovskiy et al. (2020). MOSES provides training and testing datasets, along with a comprehensive set of metrics to evaluate the quality and diversity of generated structures. By integrating MOSES, we aim to provide a robust, standardized, and high-quality generative modelling tool for the scientific community.

The API facilitates easy integration of our generative modelling tool into existing workflows and applications, accelerating the process of molecular discovery and design.
